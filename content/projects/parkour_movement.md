After graduating from college, I found that I needed an outlet for my energy during my jobsearch. Since parkour movement was a big element in my thesis project, but I was never happy with what turned out to be the final product, so I decided to revisit and refine the concept while I still have time. While I am happy with what I eventually created, it is unfortunate knowing that I did not have the time to further develop this into something more.

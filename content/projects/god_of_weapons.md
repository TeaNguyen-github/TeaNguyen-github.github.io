Fresh out of college, [God of Weapons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2342950/God_Of_Weapons/) was the first game I worked on professionally. I was brought on as a designer while it was still in a beta stage. From then on, I have been intimately involved with its many systems, from characters to items to boss designs. Since then on, it is undoubtedly the best break-in into the game industry that I could have hoped for

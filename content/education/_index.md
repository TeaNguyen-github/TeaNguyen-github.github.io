# Game Design Bachelor of Science
## Full Sail University 

During my time at Full Sail University, I was comprehensively trained in every aspects of the game development pipeline from the perspective of a game designer. During this degree program, I am educated in matters such as:
- Psychology of Play
- Scripting for Designer (Unreal Blueprint)
- System Design
- Level Design
- Game Mechanics
- Game System Integration
- Game Balancing

## College Projects
### Quantum Boxes
Quantum Boxes is an extension of the tournamental framework provided by our professor, a basic box-pushing puzzle game. As students, we were tasked with adding a new mechanic to compliment the existing game, and then marry that mechanic to another player's mechanic

I added the quantum entanglement portal, an enviromental feature that allows all objects, including the player, to simultaneously occupies all portals as long as they occupy one portal. Afterward, I combined that idea with the concept of pitfalls that another student added. This is one of my proudest achievement

### Trinary Facility Escape
Trinary facility escape is a solo project that combines both mechanics design and level design. Students were tasked with creating a new mechanic and then slowy introduced it to the player through multiple puzzles. I have elected to create a trinary logic puzzle system, completed with signal-transmitting pipes that update in real time. These trinary logic pipes can be manipulated through switches and operator to open door.

Looking back, I am regretful that I did not take more time to explain the logic and operators. The video is too short to fully showcase the concept.

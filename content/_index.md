### Greeting, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!
My name is Thai Tuan Nguyen Ngoc, though you can call me Tea if you like. I'm a passionate and professionally-trained game designer powered by my love, passion, and dedication to the art of games. I'm well-versed in many genre, but right now I'm a designer at Archmage Games Studio working on their hit title God of Weapons. 

I love working on complex, layered systems that tells stories and evoke emotions, and I've also dabbled in level design as well as C# and blueprint scripting to create prototype for my gameplay concepts. Here is where I keep a showcase of the things I think is worth showing.

# Love. Passion. Dedication.
I love games in all of its form, from the made-up things on the playground to TTRPGs to video games. I've been in love with them since before I can even remember. I've gotten into plenty of trouble over it. "You can't make games your life" is something I've heard all too often.

So I've decided to make games my life.

Here is where I showcase the things I do. If any of it caught your interest, feel free to drop me a message.

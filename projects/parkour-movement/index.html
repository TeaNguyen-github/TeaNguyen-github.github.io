        <h2>Parkour Movement</h2>    
        <p>A personal project in which I recreates several popular parkour mechanics seen in triple A video games, including sprinting, wallrunning, wall-leaping, and grappling hook</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>After graduating from college, I found that I needed an outlet for my energy during my jobsearch. Since parkour movement was a big element in my thesis project, but I was never happy with what turned out to be the final product, so I decided to revisit and refine the concept while I still have time. While I am happy with what I eventually created, it is unfortunate knowing that I did not have the time to further develop this into something more.</p>

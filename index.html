    <h2 id="intro">Greetings, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!</h2>
My name is Thai Tuan Nguyen Ngoc, though you can call me Tea if you like. I'm a passionate and professionally-trained game designer powered by my love, passion, and dedication to the art of games. I'm well-versed in many genre, but right now I'm a designer at Archmage Games Studio working on their hit title God of Weapons. 
<p>I love working on complex, layered systems that tells stories and evoke emotions, and I've also dabbled in level design as well as C# and blueprint scripting to create prototype for my gameplay concepts. Here is where I keep a showcase of the things I think is worth showing. </p>

        <h3 id="full-sail-university">Full Sail University</h3>
        <p>During my time at Full Sail University, I was comprehensively trained in every aspects of the game
            development pipeline from the perspective of a game designer. During this degree program, I am educated in
            matters such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Psychology of Play</li>
            <li>Scripting for Designer (Unreal Blueprint)</li>
            <li>System Design</li>
            <li>Level Design</li>
            <li>Game Mechanics</li>
            <li>Game System Integration</li>
            <li>Game Balancing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="quantum-boxes">Quantum Boxes</h3>
        <p>Quantum Boxes is an extension of the tournamental framework provided by our professor, a basic box-pushing
            puzzle game. As students, we were tasked with adding a new mechanic to compliment the existing game, and
            then marry that mechanic to another player's mechanic</p>
        <p>I added the quantum entanglement portal, an enviromental feature that allows all objects, including the
            player, to simultaneously occupies all portals as long as they occupy one portal. Afterward, I combined that
            idea with the concept of pitfalls that another student added. This is one of my proudest achievement</p>

        <h3 id="trinary-facility-escape">Trinary Facility Escape</h3>
        <p>Trinary facility escape is a solo project that combines both mechanics design and level design. Students were
            tasked with creating a new mechanic and then slowy introduced it to the player through multiple puzzles. I
            have elected to create a trinary logic puzzle system, completed with signal-transmitting pipes that update
            in real time. These trinary logic pipes can be manipulated through switches and operator to open door.</p>
        <p>Looking back, I am regretful that I did not take more time to explain the logic and operators. The video is
            too short to fully showcase the concept. </p>
